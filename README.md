# Mouseless - Artsite

Our site for publishing the net art we create.

## Concept

- Each post should have its own separate folder along with an `index.html` file
  in that folder
- Do not share anything code or asset between posts
- Do not do versioning like we do in development, instead copy your old post
  into a new folder, make your changes there
- You may send bugfix PRs for a post
- `index.html` will look and show a post within an `iframe`, so you are free to
  use whatever you want within a post
- Append folder name of your post to the end of `posts.json`, `index.html` will
  show posts from new to old
